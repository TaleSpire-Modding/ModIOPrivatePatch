# MOP Patch (Mod IO Private Patch... naming things is hard..., **** it, it's called MOP)
This patch allows downloading and syncing private minis from modio in Talespire from the published section. This patch requires the use of the RPC plugin for all players to benefit. Honestly hoped by now Bouncy Rock would of added this feature as a QOL improvement ended up doing this as a weekend project. This is for minis you can't share publicly such as limited licensing, or copyright issues.

## Usage
To use this, you'll need to have uploaded your private minis on mod.io and be logged in mod.io within TaleSpire.
Upon entering a campaign, open the asset browser. Then navigate Community Content => You Published Creations => Creatures => Official Repository. You'll see all your public and private minis that you have uploaded to Modio.

By clicking on the selected mini, all players currently present will start downloading the minis as if they have subscribed to the mini even though it may be private. Time taken will be dependent on internet speed & download size. Once completed, the minis will be available in the Content Subscribtion Tab where you can also unsubscribe from them.
